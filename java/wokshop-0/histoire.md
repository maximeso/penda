# History

In 1991, the team "Green Team" led by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems created a programming language for digital consumer devices. The language was called Oak then. Why Oak? Because there was an oak tree outside Gosling's office.

The "Green Team" demonstrated the use of the language with an interactive television. However, it was too advanced for the digital cable television at the time, and more suitable a technology that was starting to take off, the Internet.

Later, the language was renamed **Green** and finally renamed **Java** from Java coffee; hence the coffee-cup logo.

Since C/C++ was popular back then, James Gosling designed the language with C/C++ style syntax, and philosophy "write once, run anywhere". After years, Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation of Java in 1995. It was announced that the Netscape Navigator Internet browser would incorporate Java technology.

In 2010, Sun Microsystems was completely acquired by Oracle Corporation along with Java.
