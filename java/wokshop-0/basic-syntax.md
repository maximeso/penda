# Basic Syntax

When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.

* **Object** − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
* **Class** − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.
* **Methods** − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
* **Instance Variables** − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.
